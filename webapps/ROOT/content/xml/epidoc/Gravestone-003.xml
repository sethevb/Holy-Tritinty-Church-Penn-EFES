                <p>This twentieth century gravestone lists the name of <num xml:id="One">one</num> occupant, F. J. Gibbs.
                   We can learn his full name, Frederick John Gibbs, from the fact that this grave is managed by the <orgName>Commonwealth War Graves Commission</orgName> (<idno type="URL">https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/343723/gibbs,-frederick-john/</idno>), along with three other graves in this churchyard, however we do not know were he died, as it was also after the end of World War I.
                   From the age and the date of death, we can calculate that Frederick Gibbs was born c. 1892.
                   The date of death is also interesting as he was a serviceman who died after the end of World War I.
                   This grave is located next to the lych gate (the main entrance to the churchyard), a prominent position normally reserved for clergy or members of the church staff.</p>
