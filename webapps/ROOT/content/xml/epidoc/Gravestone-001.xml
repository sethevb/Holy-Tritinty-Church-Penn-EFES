                <p>This nineteenth century gravestone lists the names of <num xml:id="Two">two</num> occupants, a James Jarvis and his wife Martha, also presumably taking the surname Jarvis. 
                   James Jarvis was a baker in the parish. 
                   From the age and the date of death, we can calculate that James Jarvis would have been born c. 1768 and Martha would have been born c. 1758. 
                   Its location directly outside the entrance to the church suggests a certain level of status within the community, with it being place near the prominent family tombs.
                   The expression 'Sacred to the memory of' is a phrase which is used commonly among other graves of this time within this churchyard.
                   The phrase which ends the text on the tombstone in lines 13-14 is a direct quote from Genesis 18:25.</p>
