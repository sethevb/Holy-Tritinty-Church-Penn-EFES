                                     The word 'Sacred' again here uses a calligraphy style font, much like the gravestone of Elizabeth Fladgate.
                                     There are also italics used when giving the age of the person at death, the relation between the occupants, as well as other information..
                                     Much like before, where superscript has been used, the letters appears with a dot underneath.</summary>

                <p>Sacred to the memory of Mrs. Elizatbeth Stone, who died August 17th 1794, aged 67 years.
                   Also of Mrs. Sarah Gee, relict of Mr. Benjamin Gee of Hendon in Middlesex, and sister to Mr. Edmund Grove of this parish, who died March 20th 1808, aged 85 years.</p>

                <p>This nineteenth century gravestone lists the names of <num xml:id="Two">two</num> occupants, Mrs. Elizabeth Stone and Mrs. Sarah Gee. 
                   While we are not told of the relationship between Elizabeth Stone and Sarah Gee, we are told that Sarah Gee is the widow of Benjamin Gee, who lived in Hendon in London, and the sister of Edmund Grove, who appears in <idno type="URI">Gravestone006</idno>, which explains her inhumation in this churchyard. 
                   From the age and the date of death, we can calculate that Elizabeth Stone would have been born in c. 1727 and Sarah Gee would have been born in c. 1723. 
                   Due to the family relation between Sarah Gee and Edmund Grove, this gravestone is located in the same block of graves within section G of the churchyard, being four graves along from <idno type="URI">Gravestone006</idno>.
                   The expression 'Sacred to the memory of' is again used here, a phrase which is used commonly among other graves of this time within this churchyard.</p>
