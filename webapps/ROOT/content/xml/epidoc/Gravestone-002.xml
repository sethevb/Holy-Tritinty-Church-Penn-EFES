                                        There is a thin border going around the edge of the entire gravestone. 
                                        The top of the gravestone is largely decorative, with a collection of symmetrical curves, although the rest of the gravestone has a simple recangular form.</layout>

                                      The words 'Sacred' and 'Memory' at the top of the gravestone are decorative, using a form of calligraphy.
                                      The superscript 'R' in 'MR' and 'TH' in 'TH', have a dot underneath, emphasising that it is both superscript and a shortened word.</handNote>

                <p>Sacred to the memory of Elizabeth, relict of Mr. Robert Leake Fladgate, who departed this life September 5th 1937, aged 75 years.</p>
            </div>

                <p>This nineteenth century gravestone contains <num xml:id="One">one</num> person and gives only their forename, as they are the relict (widow) of Mr. Robert Leake Fladgate, who is buried in the adjacent grave, and so we are to assume that Elizabeth also takes the surname 'Fladgate'.
                   From the age and the date of death, we can calculate that Elizabeth would have been born c. 1762.
                   Its location directly outside the entrance to the church, much like the grave of James and Martha Jarvis, suggests a certain level of status within the community, with it being place near the prominent family tombs.
                   The expression 'Sacred to the memory of' is a phrase which is used again here and is commonly used among other graves of this time within this churchyard.
                   There is a large space under the age, separated by a line, suggested that room may have been left on the tombstone in order to be able to add another name on should another person be added to the grave.</p>
